Exploratory Data Analysis or (EDA) is understanding the data sets by summarizing their main characteristics often plotting them visually. This step is very important especially when we arrive at modeling the data in order to apply Machine learning. Plotting in EDA consists of Histograms, Box plot, Scatter plot, and many more. It often takes much time to explore the data.

Problem Statement:
In this project, you as a data scientist are expected to perform Exploratory data analysis on how the different features of a car and its price are related. The data comes
from the Kaggle dataset "Car Features and MSRP". It describes almost 12,000 car models, sold in the USA between 1990 and 2017, with the market price (new or used)
and some features.
